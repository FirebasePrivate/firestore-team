# Firestore Team Private Repository

This repository contains quickstart project and sample app that showcase
how to use Firestore in various different environments.


## Sample Projects

Each repository and project is as easy to work with as: 
- Cloning the repo
- Run a single command or simple instruction to clearly see that it is working.

These steps are described in individual README.md, which also outline how the
SDKs can be updated (both to a new release and  to a locally build SDK) and
how issues can be debugged.

Projects should contain as few dependencies as possible and focus on popular
dependencies.
